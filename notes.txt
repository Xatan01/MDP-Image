Server functions
1. /image (POST)
    - Accepts a file field named file (multipart/form-data).

    - Saves the raw upload to YOLOv5/uploads/.

    - Runs YOLOv5 inference with the thresholds in server/settings.py (CONF_THRESH, IOU_THRESH, IMG_SIZE, DEVICE).

    - Applies the repo-style heuristic (in server/heuristics.py):

    - Prefer the largest bounding box that is not "marker".

    - If the only detections are "marker", pick the highest-confidence one.

    - Converts YOLO class codes to the labels (in server/utils.py):

        11..19 → "1".."9"

        20..40 → "A".."U"

        "marker" → "marker"

    - Saves an annotated preview under YOLOv5/runs/<date>/<unique>/image.jpg (served by /runs/...).

    - Returns a minimal JSON (aligned with the MDP client in that repo):
